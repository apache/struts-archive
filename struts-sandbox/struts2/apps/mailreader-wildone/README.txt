README.txt - mailreader 

The MailReader demonstrates a localized application with a master/child 
CRUD workflow. 

This rendition also demonstrates using multiple Action classes as 
opposed to multiple "alias" methods. Each application "entity" has 
its own Java package, and each class in the package represents a command. 

See the Sandbox for other MailReader examples using other architectures.
