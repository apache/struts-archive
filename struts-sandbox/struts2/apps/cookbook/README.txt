README.txt - cookbook

The Cookbook is  a collection of working examples which demonstrate how to 
code common web application use cases.

The application is designed so that the code used to impolement the 
examples can be viewed online. 

This application is being retained as a placeholder until we can refactor 
the Showcase to use a similar format.
